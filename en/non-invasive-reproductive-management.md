## 🎯 Objective  
Ensure high pup survival (>85%) and maternal welfare, eliminating infanticide and abandonment caused by human-induced stress.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites  

1. **Minimum enclosure**  
   - ≥60 m² per individual  
   - Water tank ≥40% of area (≥24 m²), depth ≥1.5 m  
   - Natural substrate + private artificial dens (rock/wood)  
   - Safety area (2 m²) for non-disturbing isolation  

2. **Feeding system**  
   - *Fish-pipe*: food delivery without visual or auditory contact with humans  

3. **Behavioral monitoring**  
   - Install *trap cameras* inside dens **before parturition**  
   - Standardized ethogram for objective assessment (see Table 1)  
   - Staff training in behavioral interpretation — avoid interventions based on assumption

## 🧪 Phased protocol  

| Phase | Actions | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Pre-partum**<br>(30 days prior) | • Reduce noise and external activity<br>• Suspend all visits<br>• Enrich with nesting material (leaves, moss, roots) | Minimizes prenatal stress; stimulates natural den-building behavior |
| **Post-partum**<br>(days 0–30) | • **No handling** of pups or female<br>• Remote monitoring via *trap cameras* only<br>• Deworming **only after day 18** | Respects critical maternal bonding window; prevents human-triggered infanticide |
| **Weaning**<br>(60–90 days) | • Gradual introduction of live fish (*Geophagus*, *Tilapia*)<br>• Exposure to natural sounds (rain, birds, boats)<br>• Enrichment with submerged tunnels and obstacles | Promotes natural foraging; prepares for release/reintegration |

## 📊 Success indicators  

| Category | Indicator | Target |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Primary** | Survival to 12 months | ≥85% |
| **Secondary** | • ≥18 h/day maternal den attendance<br>• Absence of stereotypic vocalizations<br>• First independent hunting before day 45 | All must be met |

> 💡 *Note*: Since 2017, under this protocol, **zero cases of infanticide or abandonment** occurred across 10 reproductive events (18 pups born, 16 survived → 88% success rate).

---

## ⚠️ Suspension criteria  
The protocol must be reviewed if:  
- Persistent stereotypies (>10% of time over 3 consecutive days)  
- Pup rejection after 72h (sign of acute stress)  
- ≥50% litter loss due to non-clinical causes

## 🌱 Key lessons (field voice)  
> *“We learned that the greatest risk was not maternal inexperience — but our own urgency to ‘help’. Silence, privacy, and trust in the mother’s instinct were our best allies.”*
