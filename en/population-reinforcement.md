## 🎯 Objective  
To reinforce local populations of *Lontra longicaudis* in areas where wild individuals still persist, but with declining presence intensity, thereby preventing local extinction.  
→ **This is not reintroduction into vacant areas**, but **population reinforcement** of existing metapopulations (e.g., Peri Lagoon).

---

## ✅ Mandatory Prerequisites  

1. **Population diagnosis**  
   - ≥10 years of standardized monitoring of *presence intensity* (e.g., scat counts),  
   - Negative trend confirmed under IUCN Red List criteria (e.g., >90% reduction over 3 generations).

2. **Ecological viability**  
   - Confirmed presence of wild otters (even if sparse);  
   - Functional ecological corridors (e.g., Sangradouro Channel);  
   - Carrying capacity ≥1 individual/km of shoreline (e.g., Peri Lagoon: 11 km → up to 11 otters).

3. **Community acceptance**  
   - Prior engagement with local fishers, schools, and managers (e.g., via PAIE program);  
   - Mitigation plan for human–wildlife conflict (e.g., *anti-dog signage*, coexistence workshops).

## 🏗️ Minimum Pre-release Acclimatization Enclosure  

| Component | Minimum Specification | Rationale |
|----------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Transition enclosure** | 60 m² per individual | Prevents stress from overcrowding |
| **Water tank** | ≥40% of area (24 m²), depth 1.5 m | Enables swimming and foraging behavior |
| **Feeding system** | *Fish-pipe* (no visual contact with humans) | Avoids *imprinting*; preserves natural hunting |
| **Substrate & shelter** | Natural soil + artificial dens (rock/wood) | Stimulates denning and exploratory behavior |
| **Access to release site** | Safe, adjacent location for soft transition | Eliminates transport-induced stress |

---

## 🧪 Individual Preparation  

1. **Origin**: orphaned pups (rescued) or 4th-generation captive-born individuals (Refúgio Animal).  
2. **Health protocol**:  
   - Vaccination against distemper, parvovirus, leptospirosis;  
   - Deworming at 33, 18, and 3 days pre-release;  
   - Negative test for *Amblyomma ovale* and other pathogens.  
3. **Behavioral training**:  
   - Live-fish foraging (*Geophagus*, *Tilapia*);  
   - Exposure to natural sounds (rain, birds, boats);  
   - Minimum 30-day acclimatization in transition enclosure.

## 📡 Post-release Monitoring  

| Mechanism | Type | Minimum Duration |
|----------|------|------------------|
| Camera traps at known shelters (dens) | Remote monitoring | 12 months |
| Camera traps at corridor points (e.g., Sangradouro Channel outlet) | Continuous surveillance | Ongoing |
| Community monitoring | Fishers’ reports + PAIE student “sentinels” | Permanent |
| **Success indicator** | Survival >6 months + local reproduction (2–3 years) | — |

---

## ⚠️ Suspension Criteria  
The project must be paused if:  
- >50% of released individuals die within <6 months;  
- Recurrent attacks by uncontrolled domestic dogs occur;  
- Monitoring shows forced displacement into high-risk zones (e.g., gillnet areas).

---

## 🌱 Integration with Education & Policy  
1. Each release is preceded by:  
   - School workshop (featuring *Lontra-Mané*, the puppet mascot);  
   - Installation of educational signage (“This otter protects our lagoon”);  
   - Inclusion of data in PAIE (e.g., *“Adopt a Virtual Otter”* with real GPS data).  
2. Technical reports are submitted to IBAMA per Art. 12 of Normative Instruction No. 179/2008.
